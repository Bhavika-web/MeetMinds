# MeetMinds
Remember the last hackathon you wanted to take part in but couldnâ€™t due to no teammates? Thatâ€™s a petty example that perfectly portrays the aim of my app. Meet minds, as the name suggests connects people with similar interests, aims and choices. Whether you want to meet new people who think like you or want to collaborate, it is the perfectÂ appÂ toÂ goÂ for.
KEY FEATURES-
A. Chat

2)Supports both individual and group chats
3)Enhances collaboration and user engagement
4)Simple, intuitive interface for seamless communication

B. Calendar Integration
The app entails a calendar which can be used to schedule tasks, meetings or any other important events. The calendar contains features to select a date, name the event, select its timing and schedule the event. This data is saved in the other page called â€˜Schedules Tasksâ€™. The page contains all the events that have been scheduled by the user. The user can also delete a task once scheduled.

C. Hobby Selection
MeetMinds emphasizes group-to-group matching. This innovative approach allows entire friend groups to connect with others.
Users can join the various groups based on their interests and can have oppurtunity to join the community of their liking and meeting new people who share common interests.
In future updates, I aim to introduce interactive features like Hackathon groups, Reading clubs, and Discussion forums, creating more spaces for people to connect over shared passions.
